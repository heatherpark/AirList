## Usage

> AirList is a platform for users to come together and share items. A hybrid between Craigslist and AirBnb, AirList fills a need currently lacking in the sharing economy. Users can add items to rent out, and they can rent items others have posted. Currently, users must be logged in through Google to use the app.
